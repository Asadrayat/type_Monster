        <div class="box"><h1><span class="highlite">Q</span> Difference betweeen local storage & session storage ?</h1>
            <h3><span class="highlite">Ans</span> The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.</h3>
        <div class="box"><h1><span class="highlite">Q</span> Difference betweeen global scope & block scope ?</h1>
            <h3><span class="highlite">Ans</span> If you were to define some variables inside curly brackets {} or inside a specific function then those variables are called local variables The local variables have a very confined scope which is called the local scope But, with the release of ES6, the local scope was further broken down into two different scopes: a) Function scope b) Block scope
            
                Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else.

        <div class="box"><h1><span class="highlite">Q</span> What is the loop of js event ?</h1>
            <h3><span class="highlite">Ans</span>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks
                
                .</h3>
        <div class="box"><h1><span class="highlite">Q</span>How many types of undefined in javascript ?</h1>
            <h3><span class="highlite">Ans</span>Conclusion. In JavaScript, the undefined is a primitive type and has only one value “undefined”. A variable that is declared/created but not assigned with a value anywhere in the program has a default value of “undefined”.</h3>
